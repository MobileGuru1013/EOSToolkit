        Members do not authorize anyone to hold assets, borrow, nor contract on behalf of EOS token holders
        collectively. This blockchain has no owners, managers or fiduciaries; therefore, no Member shall have beneficial

        disputes arising from that contract.

        said Rules.
      </p>
      <h4>Article X - Choice of Law</h4>

      <h4>Article XI - Amending</h4>
      <p>

        continuous days within a 120 day period.

        full Ricardian contract terms to users.
      </p>
      <h4>Article XIV - Severability</h4>
      <p>
        If any part of this Constitution is declared unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will continue to be valid
        and enforceable.
      </p>
      <h4>Article XV - Termination of Agreement</h4>
      <p>
        A Member is automatically released from all revocable obligations under this Constitution 3 years after the last

        provisions then in effect for such redistribution.
